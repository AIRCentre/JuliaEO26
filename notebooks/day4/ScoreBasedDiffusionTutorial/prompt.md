@ScoreBasedDiffusionTutorial 
Can you create a jupyter notebook based on the two-d fitting of scores function @notebooks/day4/ScoreBasedDiffusionTutorial/fitting_two_dimensional_scores.jl ?

I would like it to describe score-matching (in particular the De-noising score-matching function) and explain each of the figures in the notebook. Note the dependencies and julia programming language
